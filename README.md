* Steps to run the project locally:

   ` Clone the project`

     `git clone https://github.com/Asmit2952/Asmit2952.github.io.git`

### Points to note:

* The main web page is divided into 7 sections with different css file for each.
* I have used JavaScript libraries such as [TagCloud.js](https://github.com/mcc108/TagCloud), [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/), [AOS Library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) for various animations on my web page.
* For animated rotating words implementation [read this.](https://dev.to/asmit2952/animated-text-sphere-in-javascript-using-tagcloud-js-1p72)
* For contact forms I have used [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/)
